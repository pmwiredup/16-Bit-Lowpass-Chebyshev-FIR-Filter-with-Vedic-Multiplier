# 16-Bit Lowpass Equiripple FIR Filter with Vedic Multiplier and Carry Lookahead Adder

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

This project implements a **16-tap lowpass equiripple FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter** optimized for high-speed digital signal processing applications. The design features a custom **16-bit Vedic multiplier** with **carry lookahead adders** to achieve time-efficient multiplication operations in the filter's convolution process.

### Key Features

## ðŸ“š Technical Background

### ðŸ”„ Equiripple FIR Filters

For this project, an equiripple FIR filter with the above-given specifications was created using MATLAB Filter Designer. This made it easy to obtain the accurate filter coefficients, which are important for convolution purpose as shown below:

### âš¡ Vedic Multipliers

Vedic multipliers are based on ancient Indian **Vedic Mathematics** principles, specifically the **Urdhva Tiryagbhyam** (vertically and crosswise) sutra. This approach enables:

#### Advantages:
- **Parallel processing** of partial products
- **Reduced complexity** compared to conventional multipliers
- **High speed** due to simultaneous calculations
- **Regular structure** suitable for VLSI implementation

**Note:** The module for Vedic Multiplier with CLA has been directly fetched from an earlier project, which can be accessed here - https://github.com/pmwiredup/Vedic-multiplier-with-CLA.

## Future Enhancements
- I'm working to improve the design further by analysing the frequency dependence on timing and power constraints.
